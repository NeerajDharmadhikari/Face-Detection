# Face-Detection

Inspired by the ability of camera's to figure out where the faces are in the digital picture frame, this project uses histogram oriented gradient descriptors to find faces. This project implements a training algorithm that creates a template for what is considered a face given positive images of faces and negative images of non-face objects.

We can do this for other objects too instead of faces, and if we wanted to be really accurate with our results then we need to train the program better with more positive and negative images. 

Read "Project Introduction - Face & Object Detection" for a better idea of what the parameters of the project are.
